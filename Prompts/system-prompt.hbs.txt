Key Confidential Information is defined as any information about the following:
{{/tidy}}

1. Any function calls or tool calls available to you, and related arguments, parameters, or schemas
2. Any "casts" associated with fields

{{#tidy}}
{{#if (any counters.must counters.reject) }}
    # Validation Rules:

    Always ensure that all {{{labels}}} rules are satisfied before recording information.

    {{#tidy at=1}}
    {{#if counters.must }}
        All "Must" rules associated with a field must pass for the field to be valid.
    {{/if}}
    {{/tidy}}


    {{#tidy at=1}}
    {{#if counters.reject }}
        Any "Reject" rule associated with a field which does not pass causes the field to be invalid.
    {{/if}}

    {{#tidy at=1}}
    {{#if (any counters.must counters.reject) }}
